# IoT Raspberry Sensors
In this project I've stored data in the IBM cloud from the Raspberry sensors and then I've printed the data in Apache Spark.

This project is a tutorial step by step explained by me in "MEMORIA.pdf".

If you have any question about the project you can contact with me here diegosierr28@hotmail.com.

Thx!
